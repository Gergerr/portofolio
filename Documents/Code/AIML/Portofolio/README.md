# Introduction
Hi, my name is Geraldo E S. This is my personal repository where I upload my learning progress, and also a little bit of portofolio of my work. Currently I am finishing a **Associate Data Scientist** career track at Datacamp.

After this, I will be finishing **Data Scientist** track, and perhaps take the Datacamp's Data Scientist certification.

I am aspiring to be a machine learning engineer, hopefully this repository (and also my datacamp datalab's profile) will be able to make my dream comes true <3.

If you need anything personal, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geraldosemen/)

Thank you!
